# Election-Analysis

### Project Overview
We were employed by the Colorado Board of Elections to analyze a file listing hundreds of thousands of raw votes, and display the results of the election. Specifically, we were tasked with: calculating the total number of votes, creating a complete list of candidates who recieved votes, calculate the total number of votes each candidate received, calculate the percentage of votes that each candidate won, and find the election winner based on popular vote.

### Resources
Data Source: election_results.csv
Software: Python 3.7.3 Visual Studio Code 1.46.1

### Summary
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election in total
- Three candidates recieved votes
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane
- Candidate Results
  - Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
  - Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)

- The winner of the election was Diana Degette with 272,892 votes or 73.8% of the popular vote

## Challenge Overview
In this weekly challenge we were tasked with analyzing and presenting the data in regards to county voter turnout. We were asked to add this information to our election analysis txt file that was already created for the candidate results. The method used to iterate through the raw data and pull the candidate votes and store them in a dictionary was used except this time focusing on the county votes. The method to print  county results and write the results to the txt file was also very similar to the candidate method.

## Challenge Summary
- Three counties received votes
  - Jefferson
  - Denver
  -Arapahoe
- County results
  - Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
  - Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
  - Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
  
- The largest county turnout was Denver with 306,055 votes or 82.8% of the total votes
