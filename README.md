# Election-Analysis

### Project Overview
We were employed by the Colorado Board of Elections to analyze a file listing hundreds of thousands of raw votes, and display the results of the election. Specifically, we were tasked with: calculating the total number of votes, creating a complete list of candidates who recieved votes, calculate the total number of votes each candidate received, calculate the percentage of votes that each candidate won, and find the election winner based on popular vote.
